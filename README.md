### Journal Theme For Tumblr

This is a simple, custom theme I built that has multiple features I find to be handy for Tumblr blogs, such as custom options for:

- fixed header
- fixed navigation bar
- drop-down tag links (currently editable in html, may be added to customization page in future)
- simple audio embed player (courtesy of [the "Billy" Tumblr Audio Player](http://www.sheepproductions.com/billy))
- infinite scrolling
- scroll to top
- custom backgrounds and font/link colors
- one, two or three columns

Also included is an option to add a Google Analytics tracking ID from the theme customize page.

An example of the theme (with some of these features turned on) can be viewed [here](http://www.journal--theme.tumblr.com).
